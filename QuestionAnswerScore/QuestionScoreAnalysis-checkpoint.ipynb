       "147    Hi,\\nSince 18yrs of my age, i have been diagnosed with Mild sinus migraine. I get headache when i hear loud music, sunlight and heat in aire which results in sweating and then ends with migraine. During summer in every week i take at least 2-3 times paracetamol tablets. Or if its worst i go for combination of diclofenac with paracetamol. Sometimes my headache goes very very bad, it feels like my head is goign to burst. I hate taking medicine , isn't there any permanent solution for this? I had asked my doctors, but they say there no permanent solution. My concern is, i am planning for pregnancy, So i am wondering if during that period if i get those bad headaches i wont be able to take these painkillers. Am i right? If yes, then i am really scared. Any suggestions ? \n",
